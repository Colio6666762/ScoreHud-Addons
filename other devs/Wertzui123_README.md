### FAQs:

**Q: What tags are available to be set?**<br />
A: Mostly all the tags that you could imagine are available. More details can be found in over [here](https://github.com/JackMD/ScoreHud/tree/addons). <br /><br />
**Q: There is a tag missing or I want a new tag to be added?**<br />
A: You can make a new issue with details what you want to be added. <br /><br />
**Q: How many `server-names` can I set?**<br />
A: You can set infinite many number of `server-names`. <br /><br />
**Q: I am having problems and cannot set the plugin correctly. What do I do?**<br />
A: Well you can always open a new issue on this repository or contact me via Discord: `JackMD#3717` or Twitter: `JackMTaylor_`. <br /><br />
**Q: I like the plugin. What do I do?**<br />
A: Well, that is extremely fortunate. Why not to star this repository and might as well a good review on [poggit](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/ScoreHud).<br /><br />
**Q: I could'nt find an addon for a plugin. What do i do?**<br />
A: Well, the whole process of making addon support system was simply to let other plugin authors add support for ScoreHud by making an addon themselves. My work was to make an api for them to follow. Rest is their business. So ask the author of the plugin to add support for this plugin.<br /><br />
**Q: The author of the plugin whose addon I want is no longer alive. What do I do?**<br />
A: In this case make an issue [here](https://github.com/JackMD/ScoreHud/issues) starting with `[Addon Request]` and mention in detail which plugins support you want to be added. I will then look into it.<br /><br />
